# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Silvano**. 🧝

I get things done. 🔨🔨🔨

Long time Open Source contributor, worked on tons of different projects spanning the whole stack. **Python** expert, used to work with **Go**, **C++** too. Can handle **Typescript**, **React** and **Node** but wouldn't call myself an expert. Had a brief stint with **Clojure/Script**. Trying to work more with **Rust**. I like to think of myself as a generalist.🔥

Currently working at [**deepset**][deepset], mainly on [Haystack][haystack]. 🧑‍💻

Used to work at [**Arduino**][arduino] and [**Pitch**][pitch]. 🧓

I have a neglected personal website over [here][silvanocerza-com]. 🏚️

If you want to get in touch with me I'm quite easy to find. 🗺️
